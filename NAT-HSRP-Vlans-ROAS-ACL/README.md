# 🛡️ Network Redundancy & VLAN Security Lab (Cisco CML)

Welcome to my beginner-level network engineering project!  
This lab is built using **Cisco CML** and focuses on configuring **redundancy, VLAN segmentation, DHCP, NAT, and ACLs** from scratch.

## 📌 Lab Overview

This lab demonstrates:

- 🔁 **HSRP (Hot Standby Router Protocol)** for gateway redundancy  
- 🎯 **VLAN segmentation** across two Layer 2 switches  
- 🧩 **DHCP configuration** on routers for dynamic IP allocation to VLANs  
- 🌐 **NAT (Network Address Translation)** to allow internet access  
- 🚫 **ACLs (Access Control Lists)** to restrict internet access for selected VLANs  
- 🔗 **EtherChannel** between switches for link aggregation and redundancy
